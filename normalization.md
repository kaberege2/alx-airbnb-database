## Normalization to 3NF

1. First Normal Form (1NF)

All attributes are atomic (no lists or arrays).

Each table has a single-column primary key (UUID).

2. Second Normal Form (2NF)

No partial dependencies; no composite PKs.

3. Third Normal Form (3NF)

All non-key attributes depend only on the PK.

No transitive dependencies or derived attributes.

- The design meets 3NF with clear entity separations, proper relationships, and no redundancy.
