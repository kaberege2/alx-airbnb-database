# Database Schema - Airbnb Clone

This script defines the relational schema for a simplified Airbnb-like system, including:

- Users (guests, hosts, admins)
- Properties (listed by hosts)
- Bookings (made by guests)
- Payments (for bookings)
- Reviews (of properties by guests)
- Messages (between users)

All relationships are defined with foreign keys, constraints, and indexes for performance.
